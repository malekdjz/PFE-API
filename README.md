# PFE-API
 The backend api for the patient file management app

Reworking a Laravel project in django.
The original project used Laravel for the front (blade templating egnine) and backend.
In this version i'm only making an api using django and later on will consider on how the front end will be made.

Ps:I just started learning django, let's see how long will it take me to grasp it.

Django version : 4.1.1

Django rest framework version : 3.13.1
